### Stage 2 – Video Presentation | Software Engineering and Project Management (SEPM)

This repository contains my **Stage 2 self-learning video project** for the course **Software Engineering and Project Management**.  
The topic chosen is **“Agile Software Development and Project Management”**, which explores how Agile principles and frameworks improve software delivery, collaboration, and adaptability in real-world projects.

---

## 📘 Overview

Agile Software Development is a flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes:
- Continuous collaboration and improvement  
- Early and frequent delivery of working software  
- Quick adaptation to changing requirements  
- Empowered teams and transparent workflows  

The project also covers **Agile Project Management** practices such as Scrum, Kanban, CI/CD, and team-based sprint planning — showing how they collectively improve project success rates and product quality.
